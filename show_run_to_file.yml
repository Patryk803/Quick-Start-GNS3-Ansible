## This playbook doesn't have a password so we would need to use:
## ansible-playbook tofile_playbook.yml -u patryk -k to run it
## Directory needs to be created prior to running the script

  - name: Backup show version and other user level commands
    hosts: all
    gather_facts: false
    connection: local

    tasks:
      - name: run multiple commands on remote nodes
        ios_command:
          authorize: yes
          commands:
            - show run


        register: print_output

      - debug: var=print_output.stdout_lines

      - name: save output to a file
        copy: content="{{ print_output.stdout[0] }}" dest="./output/{{ inventory_hostname }}.txt"
